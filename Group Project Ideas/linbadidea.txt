Map: set up 2-d Matrix [arrays] [Winograd's alg]
	[option 1]:

	After random time(1 min, 3min, 5min...) the room will change:
			room move around in the matrix map, but only check the exits in current_room
			BUT need to plan how the room will move to avoid [out of range error]
			more like a puzzle challenge with no story
	
	[option 2]:
		The room changes as the player explore [npc interaction]
		set up some hidden events [npc interaction or pick up something]
		the players don't know where to go, they need to check all the exits themselves

items:
	give things to npc/ get things from npc
	combain two - three items to create a new item.
