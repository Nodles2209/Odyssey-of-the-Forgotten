GENERAL PLOT:
    - Player wakes up at a mysterious, remote island without much recollection of how they arrived there
    - Since player has amnesia, they will have to set their name at the start of the play through
    - Finds a mysterious note next to them stating that a mysterious entity awaits the player at the end of the ruins,
    - Player's starting items would include this note that has the starting objective and a map of the first area

    GAME IDEA REGARDING ABOVE PLOT POINT:
        - Adding different floors/levels of exploration?
            - Player might not start at the ruins right away, and would have to instead find the ruins to explore further
            - First map can be fairly basic, no requirement of any puzzle or riddle - you start at a random part of the
              first map and your objective is simply to find the ruins and potentially collect some items that can help
              give hints or lifelines within the ruins
            - Players can view the entire map of this first stage only due to the key item - map
            - Players can also view information about a room's type through the map and what a room may contain as items
            - Above idea can use Linli's current version of her "dungeon/game", which completely randomizes the map
              layout; instead of having necessary rooms in the first map portion, all riddles/puzzles are strictly
              unnecessary and only exist to boost score/acquire lifelines

    **IMPORTANT**
    Finding the ruins must evoke a sense of urgency - this can be done through multiple ways:
        IDEA 1:
        - Only a certain number of moves can be made by the player - the player can move anywhere they want, but can
          only do so a certain amount of times (like say they can only move through 10 rooms before having to go to the
          ruins) - failure to do so would result in the player "getting lost" or "losing track of time" and getting
          killed off by the mysterious entity who would then be mad that the player "made it wait"
        - For this idea, a visual indicator can be displayed which shows the amount of moves the player can make
        - A move is determined by room changes - a player moving to a different room will count towards the move counter
          but the player interacting with objects within a room would not count

        IDEA 1.5:
        - Instead of being killed off for not making it to the ruins within the move requirement, every move taken past
          the move requirement will instead grant the player a debuff/score deduction/negative score multiplier

        IDEA 2:
        - The player must make it to the ruins within a time limit (irl time)
        - If the player is afk, this will count towards the time limit and can kill the player if the timer crosses the
          set limit

    - Once the player finds the ruins, they receive a warning stating that they can no longer leave the ruins once entered
    - Ominous text is printed once the ruins are entered (at the "start" room) stating that the ominous presence is
      delighted with the player's return
    - Another pop up message should appear indicating that a mysterious force shakes the ruins and a loud noise is heard
      (indicating the random map generation's completion)

        - The actual ruins can use the version of the map generation algorithm that Leo has designed - ruin exploration
          is BLIND, however the starting point/room is fixed

    - Some necessary rooms will be locked - requires certain items obtained from other necessary rooms
    - Optional rooms also exist to help obtain lifelines/boost/deplete score (fully random)
    - Items required for each locked room will be displayed once the player finds the exit leading to that room and attempts
      to enter said room through a pop-up - "Player does not have sufficient items to enter the room - <required item>"
    - Final room can operate in 2 ways:
        - The final room only gets generated at a random location once all the required items have been collected -
          encourages hording behaviour on the player's behalf
        - The final room is always available and the items required to unlock the room will be displayed once the player
          finds the room
    - Once final room has been unlocked and entered, an ending can be triggered depending on certain attributes

ENDING IDEAS:
    MAIN ENDING
        - The player realises that they have already been here multiple times in the past through the number of
          leaderboard entries (default set to at least 2 other entries with the leaderboard displayed)
        - The player is given their final score and their entry gets added permanently
        - **OPTIONAL** - The player can "recall" certain events of the playthrough that directly precedes the current one;
                         this can be achieved by storing certain words alongside the player's score in the leaderboard
                         (that won't be directly visible to players) that are obtained through completing certain rooms
                         and collecting certain "titles"
                       - These "titles" are strictly unimportant to gameplay and only exist as a story/lore feature
        - The player feels an ominous sense of dread and loses consciousness while having their "memories"/current
          playthrough getting forcefully wiped
        - After the memory wipe and reinitialisation of the map/rooms/items, the player is given the option to start a
          "new game" pretending that the previous playthrough did not occur
        - The only indication of the previous playthrough is stored in the leaderboard/final room

    OPTIONAL ENDINGS
        LUCKY/TRANSCENDENT ENDING
            - If the player's ending score is exceptionally high, the player can "resist" the ominous entity's forced
              reset and can "ascend" to directly confront the mysterious entity
            - The player at this point can have some options:
                - Restart the game through their own volition where
                    - They start fresh again with a completely randomised map
                    - Reset the items and score, but keep the map
                - Enter a bet with the mysterious entity where they "win" the game and get freed if they
                  solve one final riddle - guessing who the mysterious entity is (several answers can be accepted as long
                  as they are similar)
                    - Winning the bet means that the player has the ability to either continue the game or disband the
                      game completely by deleting all files associated with the game
                    - Losing the bet means that they get forcefully reset and giving up control again to the mysterious
                      entity

        UNLUCKY ENDING
            - If the player obtains a certain "unlucky" item, has a score lower than a certain threshold or enters a
              certain "unlucky" room, the playthrough automatically terminates and the mysterious entity forcefully resets
              the playthrough with no score being stored in the leaderboard

        LOST/WANDERER ENDING
            - If the player never makes it into the ruins or takes too long, or the debuff multiplier/score reduction
              is too high in the first stage, this ending is triggered where the player develops dementia and dies;
              the mysterious entity gets sad and resets the playthrough
            - **OPTIONAL** A message is generated in the playthrough directly succeeding it, which is automatically added
             to the player's inventory from the mysterious entity encouraging the player and giving the player more available
             moves to be made/a greater time limit
                - Once this playthrough is successfully completed, the message is deleted from the next playthroughs

MYSTERIOUS ENTITY'S IDENTITY:
    - Us, the programmer/programming team
    - This can be foreshadowed throughout the playthrough by having ominous messages being sent by the "mysterious entity"
      like random error messages or robotic sounding messages at random
    - Intentions of the entity: The player's life is just a game, and we're that bored lmao -
                                We don't want the character to die, hence we reset their run when they die, but we also
                                don't want the player to win easily since that would be "too boring" for the us, the devs,
                                and the player that controls the main character (even if that may be to the detriment of
                                the actual character that is going through everything against their will without any
                                knowledge that their unfortunate circumstances are just a game to some higher being)
