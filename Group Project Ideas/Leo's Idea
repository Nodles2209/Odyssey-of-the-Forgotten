My Idea is to create a randomly generated map when the game is launched, This will take all the prebuilt rooms and connect them randomly so the game has more replayability (there may have to be some rules to this generation to make the game playable, but try and keep it as random as possible).

I suggest making a puzzle/riddle based game that the player has to complete puzzles, find items like keys, solve riddles. The puzzles will give you a set amount of time before giving hints to the player and eventually skipping it (However the player will be punished for skipping, possibly by affecting their final score given at the end of the game).

To complete the game compltely you will have to revisit old rooms and to get into a final room, you will need to have visited all other rooms in the map (I suggest around 12 rooms which will keep the game small enough for the presentation, and for easily allowing the player to find their ways around).



Ideas for rooms/puzzles:

One room may have a blocked door, but a lever elsewhere in the map will open it.

A room with a riddle, that hints at bringing an Item found elsewhere in the map and bring it to the room to get unique item (key for locked door ect).

A room that when the player inspects a puzzle, when inspected a puzzle drawn in the command line will appear for the player to solve, maybe a simple sudoku or a puzzle where you rotate 4 parts of the picture until the picture matches up.



Other details we could add:

Possibly include a map funciton that allows the player to see a map but will only show rooms that the player has already visited, also gives their current location.

An system to allow the player to reprint the previous hints incase they forgot the clue/riddle (will only show the clues and riddles the player has not yet completed).
