THINGS TO CONSIDER (logic for additional features) for discussion later on:

    - Should we have different difficulty modes that change the starting stats of your player character?
        - NORMAL mode : starts at 10 base stats across all main stats with 5 sanity and 0 reputation points
        - HARD mode : starts at -10 sanity
        or have the base game start at 'HARD' mode with no difficulty mods?

    - Would an ENTITY class be easier to classify players, NPCs and monsters (that inherit from the ENTITY class)?
      If so, what attributes would the ENTITY class contain?

    - How will we navigate NPC-PLAYER dialogue?
    - How will we store dialogue options already chosen; do we need to?

    - Complexity of combat system; type of combat system if any
        - Turn based? (with user input)
        - Chance based? (roll a dice based on stats to decide subsequent events)
        - Button mashing for inputs?

    - How to implement ending conditions efficiently?
        - At a base,
            - main ending achieved by completed main story quest
            - three different endings per certain class role based on mainly sanity and maybe reputation
                - Good end
                - Neutral end
                - Bad end
            - extra endings if time is available
            - Easter egg endings based on
                - specifically around not following instructions/already established game logic
                - based on extremely biased stats (like extremely high hp, extremely low reputation etc.)

    - Text formatting using sys/time modules?
