import random #This module is needed for creating psuedo randomness in the game/map

class Map:
    '''
        This class holds values for the map and creates the map on creation, useful values in this class are:

        - self.map_matrix  this returns a 5x5 matrix which holds the room locations as objects in the matrix and empty
          spaces are set as None
        - self.entrance has easy access for getting the room object for the entrance
        - self.rooms_in_map has all the room objects in the map in a list

        Any functions built into this class that begin with 'init' are labbled because they are used for the initialisation of the map

        The map is generated randomly by having a starting point (entrance at the center of the martix),
        Then the next room to be added is picked at random from the 2 room lists, 
        The rooms in the optional_room_list are picked in a random order as it is not import where they are accessed,
        The rooms in the required_room_list are picked in the order of the list, this is to prevent situations where the player could get stuck behind a locked door with the key unaccesable behind the door,
        Next a random room is picked from the rooms already placed in the map (repeated until a room is found with an exit not already taken and not out of bounds)-This room is often called the branch_from_room in the code,
        Next an exit is picked from the possible exits,
        After this the new room is added to the map and the correct exits and lists are updated,
        This is repeated until both the room lists are empty
