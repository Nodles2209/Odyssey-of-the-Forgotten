# Odyssey of the Forgotten

## Description
Stranded on a mysterious island with no recollection of your past, you must navigate the treacherous terrain, explore ancient ruins, and solve various puzzles and riddles to piece together a functional plane and make your daring escape.

## Roadmap
**Version 1.0 (Current version)**

*Feature list:*
```
1. Randomly Generated Ruins: 
   Each playthrough offers a unique experience as the island's ancient ruins shift and change, presenting new challenges and mysteries to solve with every playthrough!

2. A variety of Puzzles and Riddles: 
   Investigate the mysterious markings found deep within the ruins and uncover the hidden messages that were intended to be hidden away for eternity.
   
   Base Puzzles:
   -    Sudoku
   -    Chess
   -    Connect the wire

5. Exploration: 
   Scour the island's lush, uncharted wilderness for resources, tools, and hidden artifacts, using them to construct vital components for your plane.

6. Choices and Consequences - Multiple Endings:
   Your decisions influence the outcome of your adventure. Will you take the risk and delve into uncharted territory for a great reward at the end, or will you play it safe and quietly leave the island, leaving no trace of your exploits?
```

**Version 1.1 (Future patch)**

*Features still work in progress*
```
1. Leaderboards: 
   Store your scores and compete against your previous playthroughs to give your final endings some more meaning
   
2. Titles: 
   Collect various titles based on your achievements and exploits within the ruins!

5. More rooms:
   As time goes on, you find out that the ruins were even more vast than you imagined, brimming with experiences never seen before; perhaps there is more to the ruins than one might have initially thought

6. Choices and Consequences:
   Your decisions influence the outcome of your adventure. Will you take the risk and delve into uncharted territory for a great reward at the end, or will you play it safe and quietly leave the island, leaving no trace of your exploits?

7. A race against time:
   The more you begin to understand of the ruins, the more you realise how precarious your situation is... You find that your time is quickly running out, lest you get consumed by the ruins and the mysteries that surround it... Will you find all the parts and make it out in time?

## Bugs to be fixed
```
For answer_check() within the Chess class:
Regex will need to be updated to account for potential inputs such as qe8x3 sending an "incorrect answer" flag rather than a "incorrect format" flag

for puzzle_pip.py:
May need to rework the swap and open logic to account for incidents where you may reopen a spot that was already opened and swapped, resulting in the slot to return to its original state instead
```
