"""

Rooms and connections are stored as a 2D matrix where:
    1 or 0 determine connection status (1 indicating there is a connection present and 0 indicating no connection),
    Room number is any integer greater than one (then subtracted by 1),
    for example :
    Room 1 = 2 on the matrix,
    Room 9 = 10 on the matrix,
    and so on for all the rooms

**IMPORTANT**
Room display logic is SUBJECT TO CHANGE since formatting for room numbers with digits greater than one have not been
considered yet

This program is also SUBJECT TO CHANGE to be made into a function for later use; is currently in TESTING state, using
predefined values
